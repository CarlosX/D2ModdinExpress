              h3 The Launcher
              p.justify D2MPLauncher downloads the mod manager to a temporary directory on your computer. The launcher then runs the D2Moddin manager, which minimizes to your Windows tray. It will either update your existing manager, launch it if it is up to date, or download it for the first time.
            .col-md-4
              h3 The Manager
              p.justify The D2Moddin manager downloads local files (mdoels, textures, and UI files) to your Dota 2 addons directory. It does not modify any files and is designed to be as temporary as possible.
            .col-md-4
              h3 Uninstalling
              p.justify If you wish to remove the manager and all mods from your system, right click the manager in your system tray and click uninstall. This will delete the manager and all addons.
